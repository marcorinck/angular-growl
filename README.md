> growl like notifications for angularJS projects, using bootstrap alert classes

##Features

![Standard bootstrap 2.x styles](doc/screenshot.jpg)

* growl like notifications like in MacOS X
* using standard bootstrap classes (alert, alert-info, alert-error, alert-success)
* global or per message configuration of a timeout when message will be automatically closed
* automatic translation of messages if [angular-translate](https://github.com/PascalPrecht/angular-translate) filter is
present, you only have to provide keys as messages, angular-translate will translate them
* pre-defined $http-Interceptor to automatically handle $http responses for server-sent messages
* automatic CSS animations when adding/closing notifications (only when using >= angularJS 1.2)
* < 1 kB after GZIP

##Installation

You can install angular-growl with bower:

> bower install angular-growl

Alternatively you can download the files in the [build folder](build/) manually and include them in your project.

````html
<html>
    <head>
        <link href="bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <script src="angular.min.js"></script>
        <script src="angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>

        <link href="angular-growl.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <script src="angular-growl.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
````

As angular-growl is based on its own angularJS module, you have to alter your dependency list when creating your application
module:

````javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['angular-growl']);
````

Finally, you have to include the directive somewhere in your HTML like this:

````html
<body>
    <div growl></div>
</body>
````

##Usage

Just let angular inject the growl Factory into your code and call the 4 functions that the factory provides accordingly:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
    $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
        growl.addWarnMessage("This adds a warn message");
        growl.addInfoMessage("This adds a info message");
        growl.addSuccessMessage("This adds a success message");
        growl.addErrorMessage("This adds a error message");
    }
}]);
````

If [angular-translate](https://github.com/PascalPrecht/angular-translate) is present, its filter is automatically called for translating of messages, so you have to provide
only the key:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
    $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
        growl.addSuccessMessage("SAVE_SUCCESS_MESSAGE");
        growl.addErrorMessage("VALIDATION_ERROR");
    }
}]);
````

##Configuration

###Automatic closing of notifications (timeout, ttl)
Standard behaviour is, that all notifications need to be closed manually by the user.

However, you can configure a global timeout (TTL) after which notifications should be automatically closed.  To do
this, you have to configure this during config phase of angular bootstrap like this:

````javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['angular-growl']);

app.config(['growlProvider', function(growlProvider) {
    growlProvider.globalTimeToLive(5000);
}]);
````

This sets a global timeout of 5 seconds after which every notification will be closed.

You can override TTL generally for every single message if you want:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
    $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
        growl.addWarnMessage("Override global ttl setting", {ttl: 10000});
    }
}]);
````

This sets a 10 second timeout, after which the notification will be automatically closed.

If you have set a global TTL, you can disable automatic closing of single notifications by setting their ttl to -1:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
    $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
        growl.addWarnMessage("this will not be closed automatically even when a global ttl is set", {ttl: -1});
    }
}]);
````

###Animations

Beginning with angularJS 1.2 growl messages can be automatically animated with CSS animations when adding and/or closing
them. All you have to do is load the angular-animate.js provided by angularJS and add **ngAnimate** to your applications
dependency list:

````html
<html>
    <head>
        <link href="bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <script src="angular.min.js"></script>
        <script src="angular-animate.min.js"></script>

        <link href="angular-growl.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <script src="angular-growl.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
````

````javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['angular-growl', 'ngAnimate']);
````

That's it. The angular-growl.css comes with a pre-defined animation of 0.5s to opacity.

To configure the animations, just change the _growl-item.*_ classes in the css file to your preference. F.i. to change length
of animation from 0.5s to 1s do this:

````css
.growl-item.ng-enter,
.growl-item.ng-leave {
    -webkit-transition:1s linear all;
    -moz-transition:1s linear all;
    -o-transition:1s linear all;
    transition:1s linear all;
}
````

Basically you can style your animations just as you like if ngAnimate can pick it up automatically. See the [ngAnimate
docs](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) for more info.

###Handling of server sent notifications

When doing $http requests, you can configure angular-growl to look automatically for messages in $http responses, so your
business logic on the server is able to send messages/notifications to the client and you can display them automagically:

````javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['angular-growl']);

app.config(['growlProvider', '$httpProvider', function(growlProvider, $httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push(growlProvider.serverMessagesInterceptor);
}]);
````

This adds a pre-defined angularJS HTTP interceptor that is called on every HTTP request and looks if response contains
messages. Interceptor looks in response for a "messages" array of objects with "text" and "severity" key. This is an example
response which results in 3 growl messages:

````json
{
    "someOtherData": {...},
	"messages": [
		{"text":"this is a server message", "severity": "warn"},
		{"text":"this is another server message", "severity": "info"},
		{"text":"and another", "severity": "error"}
	]
}
````

You can configure the keys, the interceptor is looking for like this:

````javascript
var app = angular.module("demo", ["angular-growl"]);

app.config(["growlProvider", "$httpProvider", function(growlProvider, $httpProvider) {
	growlProvider.messagesKey("my-messages");
	growlProvider.messageTextKey("messagetext");
	growlProvider.messageSeverityKey("severity-level");
	$httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push(growlProvider.serverMessagesInterceptor);
}]);
````

Server messages will be created with default TTL.
