#angular-growl-2
Growl like notifications for angularJS projects, using bootstrap alert classes, originally developed by Marco Rinck and Jan Stevens

##Features

![Standard bootstrap 2.x styles](doc/screenshot.jpg)

* growl like notifications like in MacOS X
* using standard bootstrap classes (alert, alert-info, alert-error, alert-success)
* global or per message configuration of a timeout when message will be automatically closed
* automatic translation of messages if [angular-translate](https://github.com/PascalPrecht/angular-translate) filter is
present, you only have to provide keys as messages, angular-translate will translate them
* pre-defined $http-Interceptor to automatically handle $http responses for server-sent messages
* automatic CSS animations when adding/closing notifications (only when using >= angularJS 1.2)
* < 1 kB after GZIP

##Installation

You can install angular-growl-v2 with bower:

> bower install angular-growl-v2

Alternatively you can download the files in the [build folder](build/) manually and include them in your project.

````html
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="angular.min.js"></script>

    <link href="angular-growl.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="angular-growl.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
````

As angular-growl is based on its own angularJS module, you have to alter your dependency list when creating your application
module:

````javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['angular-growl']);
````

Finally, you have to include the directive somewhere in your HTML like this:

````html
<body>
    <div growl></div>
</body>
````

##Usage

Just let angular inject the growl Factory into your code and call the 4 functions that the factory provides accordingly:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
  $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
    growl.warning("This adds a warn message");
    growl.info("This adds a info message");
    growl.success("This adds a success message");
    growl.error("This adds a error message");
  }
}]);
````

The title must be set as a configuration parameter:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
  $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
    growl.warning("This adds a warn message", {title: 'Warning!'});
    growl.info("This adds a info message", {title: 'Random Information'});
    growl.success("This adds a success message"); //no title here
    growl.error("This adds a error message", {title: 'ALERT WE GOT ERROR'});
  }
}]);
````

If [angular-translate](https://github.com/PascalPrecht/angular-translate) is present, its filter is automatically called for translating of messages, so you have to provide
only the key:

````javascript
app.controller("demoCtrl", ['$scope', 'growl', function($scope, growl) {
  $scope.addSpecialWarnMessage = function() {
      growl.success("SAVE_SUCCESS_MESSAGE");
      growl.error("VALIDATION_ERROR");
  }
}]);
````

## Configuration/Documentation/Info
For the configuration options, documentation and live examples visit the github pages:

## [http://janstevens.github.io/angular-growl-2/](http://janstevens.github.io/angular-growl-2/)

Live demo's can be found on the following codepen collection:

## [Codepen Collection](http://codepen.io/collection/Jhcpi/)

This stops messages from closing when mouse is over:

````javascript
app.config(['growlProvider', function (growlProvider) {
  growlProvider.globalPauseOnMouseOver(true);
}]);
````
